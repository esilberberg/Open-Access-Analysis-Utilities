# Scholarly Communication Tools: For Open Access Publishing in Education

This project uses Google's PaLM LLM and Sherpa/Romeo APIs to automate the extraction of journal names and corresponding open access (OA) policies from a list of citations in an Excel file. By producing a report of OA policies per citation, the project hopes to empower researchers to make their work OA.

Requires API keys for Google PaLM and Sherpa Romeo.
