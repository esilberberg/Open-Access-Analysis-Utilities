# Scholarly Communication Tools: For Open Access Publishing in Education

This project automates the process of finding Open Access (OA) policies for research citations. 

It leverages two APIs to achieve this:
- [Google's Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs): This API assists in identifying journal names from a list of citations provided in an Excel file.
- [Sherpa Romeo API](https://www.sherpa.ac.uk/api/): This API retrieves information about Open Access policies for the identified journals.

The project generates a report that details the OA policies for each citation. This report empowers researchers by simplifying the process of understanding where and how they can openly share their work.

Requires API keys from Gemini and Sherpa Romeo.
